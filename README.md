<h2 id="about-the-project"> :moneybag: About The Project</h2>

bitcoin-exchange, as you can imagine, is a Bitcoin exchange.

In particular, it is a very simple simulation that tries to reproduce the functioning of a real exchange.



<h3 id="built-with"> :wrench: Built With</h3>

It's made up using [Djongo](https://www.djongomapper.com/), an extension to the traditional [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) ORM framework.

The part relating to the front-end instead is created using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).




<h2 id="how-it-works"> :unlock: About The Project</h2>

Each user can register with a username and password.

At the end of the registration each user receives 2 random bonuses:
<li>A number of bitcoins between 0 and 10</li>
<li>A number of dollars between 0 and 1,000,000</li>

Using these bonuses each user can create buy or sell orders.

Whenever possible, each buy order is matched with an appropriate sell order and vice versa.
